# The-Town-of-Liars

There is a town where everyone is either a liar or a truth-teller. You meet two people, A and B. You know that one of them is a liar and one of them is a truth-teller. You ask them both the same question: "Is the other person a liar?"

What is the answer to the question, and how do you know?

Solution:

The answer to the question is that both A and B are liars. This is because if A is a truth-teller, then B must be a liar. However, if B is a liar, then A must also be a liar. Therefore, both A and B must be liars.
